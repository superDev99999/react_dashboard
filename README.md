# [WIP] Administration dashboard template in React
This is an administration dashboard template made with React.js in ES6 JavaScript (using Babel as transpiler).
That means there are reusable components and one-way reactive data flow is already implemented.

# TODOs
This template is still work in progress. There are many things to be done such as:

	- test support on older browsers
	- add more UI elements - tooltips, user popover, buttons, more meaningful boxes to the dashboard
	- add Quick Settings box content
	- add optional action buttons to the DataTable
	- add UI responsiveness
	- refactor forms to be modular (make fields components etc.)
	- add form validation
	- edit data flow to match current best practices
	- ...
